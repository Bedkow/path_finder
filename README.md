*under development*

### A single file app that lets the user draw paths from point A to point B ~~and uses an algorithm to choose the shortest one~~.

Tech:
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS
- HTML Canvas

No bundlers, compilers, webpacks, and other crap. Just download the index.html file and run it in a modern browser (like the newest version of Google Chrome)

*currently PC only*
